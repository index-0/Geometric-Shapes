#### Mobius Strip

  <h5>Definition</h5>
  <p>
  The Möbius strip is a surface with only one side (when embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space) and only one boundary.
  </p>
  <h5>Properties</h5>
  <ul>
  <li>The Möbius strip has several curious properties. A line drawn starting from the seam down the middle meets back at the seam, but at the other side. If continued, the line meets the starting point, and is double the length of the original strip. This single continuous curve demonstrates that the Möbius strip has only one boundary.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li>Cutting a Möbius strip along the center line with a pair of scissors yields one long strip with two full twists in it, rather than two separate strips; the result is not a Möbius strip. This happens because the original strip only has one edge that is twice as long as the original strip. Cutting creates a second independent edge, half of which was on each side of the scissors. Cutting this new, longer, strip down the middle creates two strips wound around each other, each with two full twists.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li>If the strip is cut along about a third of the way in from the edge, it creates two strips: One is a thinner Möbius strip – it is the center third of the original strip, comprising one-third of the width and the same length as the original strip. The other is a longer but thin strip with two full twists in it – this is a neighborhood of the edge of the original strip, and it comprises one-third of the width and twice the length of the original strip.</li>
  </ul>
